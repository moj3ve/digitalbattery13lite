# digitalbattery13lite

Fixes and changes here will make their way into the full version, this release has some crinkles ironed out already

Features: percentage in statusbar (cc statusbar has been made stock), font/positioning options, new disable charging animations toggle, colors toggle, an incomplete and disabled low power banner toggle

(you will need to remove digitalbattery13 prior to installing the deb, colorpicker has been removed from the Lite version)
